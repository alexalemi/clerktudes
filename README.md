# Clerktudes

Inspired by Peter Norvig's [pytudes](https://github.com/norvig/pytudes) these clerktudes
are short Ã©tudes (a French word meaning study) in [clojure](https://clojure.org) in [clerk](https://clerk.vision).

These are also meant to be visible on [clerk.garden](https://clerk.garden) at
[github.clerk.garden/alexalemi/clerktudes](https://github.clerk.garden/alexalemi/clerktudes)
